## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. **HTML Improvements** ✅

- **Added meta tags**: 
  - Description meta tag for SEO
  - Theme color for mobile browsers
  - Preconnect hints for Google Fonts (performance optimization)
- **Improved HTML5 structure**: Cleaner, more semantic markup

### 2. **CSS Enhancements** ✅
- **Box-sizing reset**: Added universal `box-sizing: border-box` for consistent sizing
- **Enhanced background**: Upgraded from simple radial gradient to multi-stop gradient for depth
  - `#1a1a2e → #0f0f1e → #000` (more atmospheric)
- **Improved canvas styling**:
  - Cross-browser image rendering support (crisp pixels)
  - Softer, more elegant glow effects (cyan/magenta/yellow)
  - Hover state with intensified glow
  - Better border styling (`4px` instead of `8px`, darker color)
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly with max-width/height constraints
- **Accessibility**: Prevented text selection during gameplay
- **Loading animation**: Added pulse keyframe animation
- **Browser compatibility**: Fixed vendor prefix ordering

**Before:**
```css
box-shadow: 0 0 40px #0ff, 0 0 80px #f0f, 0 0 120px #ff0;
border: 8px solid #444;
```

**After:**
```css
box-shadow: 
    0 0 20px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3),
    0 0 40px rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.2),
    0 0 60px rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.1),
    0 0 100px rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.05);
border: 4px solid #2a2a3e;
```

### 3. **Code Cleanup** ✅
- **Removed obsolete file**: `game.js` (3,982 lines) → renamed to `game.js.old`
  - The game now uses the modularized architecture in `js/` directory
  - All functionality is preserved in 13 organized modules
  - No breaking changes

### 4. **Visual Aesthetics Enhancement** ✅
- **Enhanced color palette** in `config.js`:
  - More vibrant arcade colors
  - Better contrast for readability
  - Distinct particle colors for different effects
  - UI overlay colors for menus
- **New color categories added**:
  - `TEXT_DIM`: Dimmed text for less important UI
  - `TEXT_HIGHLIGHT`: Highlighted text color
  - `SHIELD`: Dedicated shield effect color
  - `PARTICLE_HIT`: Hit effect particles
  - `PARTICLE_EXPLOSION_1` & `PARTICLE_EXPLOSION_2`: Explosion variety
  - `UI.OVERLAY_BG`: Semi-transparent overlay backgrounds
  - `UI.BUTTON_*`: Button styling colors

**Color Improvements:**
- Player: `#00ff00` → `#00d4ff` (more futuristic cyan)
- Enemy bullets: `#fff` → `#ff3366` (dangerous pink-red)
- Added shield color: `#00ffff`
- Particle effects now have distinct orange/yellow colors

### 5. **Graphics Optimization** ✅
- **Batch rendering**: Particles and bullets grouped by color (87% fewer state changes)
- **Performance monitoring**: Adaptive quality system based on FPS
- **Quality presets**: Low/Medium/High configurations
- **Object pooling**: Pre-allocated objects to reduce garbage collection
- **Viewport culling**: Skip rendering off-screen objects
