## [1.0.0] - Previous Version

### Initial Implementation
- Basic Galaga-inspired game
- Simple enemy shapes
- Player movement and shooting
- Basic collision detection
- Firebase high score integration
- Arcade splash screen
- GraphicsOptimizer foundation

## Upgrade Notes

**Breaking Changes from 1.0:**
- Enemy rendering now uses `EnemyManager.draw()` instead of individual enemy drawing
- Collision detection uses circular bounds instead of AABB
- High score entry now requires 5 characters instead of 3
- Powerups now managed by `PowerupManager`

**Migration:**
- If you had custom enemy types, they need to be added to `AlienSprites`
- Custom collision code may need adjustment for circular detection
- Firebase database structure is compatible, no migration needed
